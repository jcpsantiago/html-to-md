# html-to-md

A Clojure library designed to convert (Enlivened) HTML to markdown; but, more
generally, a framework for [HT|SG|X]ML transformation.

## Introduction

The itch I'm trying to scratch at present is to transform
[Blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com)'s dreadful tag-soup markup into markdown;
but my architecture for doing this is to build a completely general [HT|SG|X]ML
transformation framework and then specialise it.
